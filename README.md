# 💫 About Me

🎮 I am currently exploring Blender, Unity, and C# to dive into AR/VR development, while also building **Project99**—a jewelry mobile application powered by React Native, Node.js, Express, and Redis.

🤝 Open to collaborating on full-stack projects, UI/UX design, and SaaS applications, I am always seeking advice on scaling backend architectures and optimizing database performance.

🌱 My current learning focus includes advanced Node.js patterns, Agentic AI, Generative AI, and the latest frontend technologies.

💬 If you want to chat about React, Generative AI, UI/UX, or modern web tech, just ask!

⚡ Fun fact: I love turning static designs into interactive, dynamic web apps.
