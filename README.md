# 💫 About Me

I am currently exploring Blender, Unity, and C# to dive into AR/VR development, while also building **Project99**—a jewelry mobile application powered by React Native, Node.js, Express, and Redis. Open to collaborating on full-stack projects, UI/UX design, and SaaS applications, I am always seeking advice on scaling backend architectures and optimizing database performance. My current learning focus includes advanced Node.js patterns, Agentic AI, Generative AI, and the latest frontend technologies. If you want to chat about React, Generative AI, UI/UX, or modern web tech, just ask!  
Fun fact: I love turning static designs into interactive, dynamic web apps.
